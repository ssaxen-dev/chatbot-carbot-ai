## Objective

In today’s digital world, the sheer number of options and limited personalized guidance can make buying a car feel overwhelming. To make things easier, we've developed Car Buy AI chatbot that combines the power of large language models with rule-based functions to provide information that’s both accurate and dependable.

Create a smart assistant bot that suggests cars tailored to users' preferences and budget for individuals seeking cars with user's specifications.

Simplified car selection process basis keypoints: (based on data excel)

- Car category 
- Kmpl (Average of 4-wheeler)
- Transmission
- Seater
- Fuel type
- Price (in INR)
