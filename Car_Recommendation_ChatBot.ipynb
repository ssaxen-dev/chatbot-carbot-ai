    "- **An Introduction to Using LLM APIs:** We've learned how to make API calls to OpenAI's GPT-3.5, specifically using the Chat Completion API, to create a straightforward AI tutor.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Foundations of Prompt Engineering:** Essential principles include **providing clear instructions** and **enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities**. We use structured prompts that incorporate Task, Role, Context, Guidelines, and Output Format to enhance clarity and effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sophisticated Prompting Techniques:** Techniques such as **Chain-of-Thought** and **Few-Shot prompting** support step-by-step solution elaboration and offer examples of desired outputs. Additional approaches like **self-consistency** and **ReAct prompting** enhance response reliability and contextual awareness.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **LLM-Based Systems design:** In addition to exploring prompting techniques, we’ve focused on safe design practices, like using OpenAI's moderation API to manage unsafe queries and guard against prompt injections. With this groundwork in place, we’re ready to create our first LLM-powered app: Car Buy AI, a friendly chatbot that helps users find the perfect car based on their needs.\n",

    "- **`dictionary_present()`**: It ensures that the user’s profile is accurately represented in a Python dictionary by extracting the relevant data.\n",
